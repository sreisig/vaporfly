1. Check that R2 is working correctly
    - Plot predicted vals?
        - Ask Dr. Hammerling about how to plot nicely
    - Output fit output while training
        - RSS
        - R2, MSE
    - Add rss_keras to all model metrics
    - in get_train_test make sure that splitting functionality for r2 working correctly
2. Bin runners by time/gender
    - Bin by quartile
    - Bin by range
3. Get good R2 on just training set (don't split to training/test)
    - Maybe have code s.t. only one point in test set
4. Try different input combinations/transformations
    - Current: 
        - Normal: Race & Gender
        - Vaporfly: Gender
    - Alternative:
        - Additive layer for Race
            - Won't be learning runner/race combos will just be adding difference race makes
            - Basically emulating a additive model at this point
        - Normal: Runner, Gender depending on if splitting networks
        - Vaporfly: Gender depending on if splitting
5. Runner, race in normal inputs, heavy l1 l2 regularization
    - Can't include vaporfly effect on race/runner combos
6. Add log transform to y values
7. Actually do random effects
